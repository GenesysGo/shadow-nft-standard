# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, both online and
offline, and extends to all activities and interactions related to the
development, promotion, and usage of the crypto and digital community standards,
including but not limited to the discussion, creation, and implementation of a
new digital NFT standard. This standard aims to be a comprehensive,
community-owned, and community-driven universal solution for NFT image and
metadata handling, ensuring a fair, transparent, and inclusive environment for
all participants.

The scope of this Code of Conduct encompasses all communication channels,
forums, social media platforms, and events where individuals are officially
representing the community or contributing to the development and promotion of
the NFT standard. Examples of representing our community include using an
official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
participating in community-hosted events, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

In addition to the general behavioral expectations outlined in this Code of
Conduct, members of the crypto and digital community must also adhere to the
following guidelines specific to the development and promotion of the NFT
standard:

-   Collaborate openly and transparently, ensuring that all decisions and
    actions are made with the best interests of the community in mind
-   Respect the intellectual property rights of others, giving proper
    attribution and credit where it is due
-   Encourage the adoption of decentralized and open-source solutions that
    empower the community and promote inclusivity
-   Actively listen to and consider feedback from the community, incorporating
    diverse perspectives and ideas to create a more robust and universally
    applicable standard
-   Promote the responsible and ethical use of technology, considering the
    potential social, environmental, and economic impacts of the NFT standard

By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to foster a thriving, collaborative, and
innovative community that supports the development and adoption of a universal
NFT standard that benefits all participants in the crypto and digital space.
